# Image Generator for FPGA Evaluation Board

Design of an image generator to represent a street scene. Can be used as a stand-alone design for image generator or as a test pattern generator for a lane detection circuit.

Design uses DE10-Lite board from Terasic, but can be adapted to other FPGA evaluation boards with a video output.
